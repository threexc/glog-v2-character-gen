1. Can you provide Rust code for taking user input for a character name
and level, which then generates values for the six standard D&D ability
scores and writes the name, level, class, race, and ability scores to a
file? The list of possible races and classes should be read from a
configuration file.

2. Can you modify it so that if the random class selected is Wizard,
then it selects a further "archetype" from the following list? The
resultant class written to the output file should be formatted like
"Wizard (Archetype)":

    Alchemist Pyromancer Necromancer

3. When I do "cargo run", I see:

```
error[E0412]: cannot find type ThreadRng in crate rand
   --> src/main.rs:135:39
    |
135 | fn roll_ability_score(rng: &mut rand::ThreadRng) -> u8 {
    |                                       ^^^^^^^^^ not found in rand
    |

135 + fn roll_ability_score(rng: &mut ThreadRng) -> u8 {
    |

```

4. can you make two additional modifications:

    - remove the need to specify a character name, and don't write it to
    the output file
    - allow the user to specify how many characters to generate, then
    randomly generate that many. They should all be written to the same
    output file

5. It looks like the output got mangled

6. What I meant was that the code you are producing seems to have a
function above the use directives, which doesn't make sense

7. Can you go back to version 10 but make the layout fix?

8. I see many errors like this when I try to run it:

```
error[E0277]: the type [Character] cannot be indexed by u32
  --> src/main.rs:70:42
   |
70 |         println!("Level: {}", characters[i].level);
   |                                          ^ slice indices are of type usize or ranges of usize
   |
   = help: the trait SliceIndex<[Character]> is not implemented for u32
           but it is implemented for usize
   = help: for that trait implementation, expected usize, found u32
   = note: required for Vec<Character> to implement std::ops::Index<u32>
```

9. If this needed to be run on a web server and the character generation
process accessible via text boxes and a button saying "Generate" with
the character outputs then shown on the webpage, how do you extend it?

10. What if I would like to have both the CLI and web version and have
them use the same common logic for generating characters?

11. I see the following errors when I run the web version:

```

12. Can you explain this line?

```
let mut rolls: Vec<u8> = (0..4).map(|_| rng.gen_range(1..=6)).collect();
```
